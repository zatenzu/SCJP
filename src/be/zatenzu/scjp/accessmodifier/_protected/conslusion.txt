Acces to protected member via an class instance
================================================
If you are in the same package as what you want to access and you pass by an instance of the class
who contents the protected member, or an instance of a class who extends the class who contents the protected
member, it's ok.
OR
your are in the class of the instance that you use to access to the protected member
and this class extends the class who has the protected member.
